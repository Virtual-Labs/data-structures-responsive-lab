		  <ul>   <h3> The Array Data Structure </h3> 
		<li>In this framework, we now see the array as a data structure. The typical operations on this data structure are as follows:</li>
		<li>♦ to create an array data structure, called create(name, size), </li>
		<li>♦ to access the element at a given index i, called ElementAt(index, name), </li>
		<li>♦ to find the size of the array, called size(name), and </li>
		<li>♦ to print the contents of the array, called print(name).</li>
		<li>While we are used to writing A[i] to access element i of an array A, it can be seen as the way to access the ith element in a non-object oriented programming language. The other operations are also not explicity specified when one uses languages such as C. But, when one considers purely object oriented languages, such operations are required to be supported. Similarly, in C, array creation is done by malloc() or a compile time declaration as int A[10];. However, when one looks at a data structure in terms of its operations, a create() operation is required.
		</li></ul></p>

			         <h3> 1.Sorting </h3>
			<ul><li>Sorting is a fundamental operation and we shall see two sorting algorithms in this section.</li>
			 
			<h3>1.1 Merge Sort </h3>
			<li>The idea of merge sort is to shift the onus to the combine step. To this end, we come up with the following design</li>
			<li>♦ Divide the n element input into two n/2 element sequences.</li>
			<li>♦ Sort the n/2 element sequences recursively.</li>
			<li>♦ Merge the two n/2 element sequences into a sorted n element sequence.</li>
			<li>The only non straightforward operation in the above is the last step. So let us first concentrate on this step. The job is to merge two sorted sequences. For this, we can think of comparing elements of the two sorted sequences and iteratively constructively the required sorted array. For simplicity let us assume that elements in arrays L and R each of size l + 1 and r + 1 respectively are to be merged into an array A of size l + r. The elements indexed l + 1 and r + 1 are set to 1 in L and R respectively. The following performs the merge:

			<li>
      1.Procedure Merge(L,R,A) 1. i = 1, j = 1</li> 
			<li>2. for k = 1 to l + r do </li>
			<li>3.if L[i] < R[j] then </li>
			<li>4. A[k] = L[i]; i = i + 1</li> 
			<li>5.else </li>
			<li>6.A[k] = R[j]; j = j + 1;</li>
			<li>7.End
      </li></p><br>
       
        <p>
			        <h3> 1.2 Quick Sort </h3>
			<li>Let us look at one final example of sorting algorithms along with a short proof of correctness. While merge sort can be said to be optimal in terms of its time requiement, it does use some extra space. So one question to prusue is to design a sorting algorithm that can sort in-place, i.e., without using any extra space.C. A. R. Hoare gave an algorithm based on the divide and conquer strategy called the quick sort that can sort in place. The 3 steps of the algorithm in the framework of divide and conquer are:</li>
			<li>♦ Divide: Divide the input into 3 parts L,E, and R where L < E < R based on a pivot.</li>
			<li>♦ Conquer: Solve the sorting problem recursively on L and R. Assuming that all the items are distinct,we have that |E| = 1 hence already sorted.</li>
			<li>♦ Combine: Produce the sorted L, E, and R in that order.</li>
			<li>One can notice that the third step is quite trivial here. In fact, this is an example of the so called partition based algorithms. Let us look at the only non-trivial step, that of partitioning the input. The key to the partition step is to select a pivot and rearrange the elements of the array. For this the following approach is presented. </li>
			<li>1. Procedure Parition(A, l, h)</li>
			<li>2. pivot = A[h];</li>
			<li>3. i = l - 1; 4. for j = p to h - 1 do</li>
			<li>5. if A[j] <= pivot</li>
			<li>6. i = i + 1;</li>
			<li>7. swap A[i] with A[j]</li>
			<li>8. swap A[i + 1] with A[h]</li>
			<li>9. End Procedure</li>

           <h3>Easy Questions </h3>
<ul>Answer the following questions with respect to sorting algorithms on arrays.

<li>1. Are there sorting algorithms that take the same asymptotic runtime irrespective of the input?</li>

<li>2. Most of the algorithms we studied so far made no assumptions on the maximum input values in the input. When some bounds on the input values are known, it is possible to design sorting algorithms that benefit from this knowledge. A simple example is the following: Let A be a set of n numbers whose values are between 1 to O(n). Now, to sort A, declare an array B of size max A[i]. Mark B[i] as 1 iff A[j] = i. Now, print i if B[i] =1 in increasing order of i. Can you modify this scheme when the maximum number in A in more than O(n), say in O(n^2), while still using only |A| space? </li>

<li>3. An inversion is a pair of indices $i$ and $j$ so that $A[i]$ more than A[j]$ but $i$ is less than j$, i.e., elements are not in the natural(sorted) order. Design an algorithm based on sorting algorithms to count the number of inversions in a given array A of n numbers.
  </li>
         </ul>
        </p>
        <p>

        <h3>Difficult Questions </h3>
<p>Notice that for merge sort to work, one does not need to know the entire data at once. Consider settings where the entire data may not it into the memory of a computer system. In that case, one can bring in as much data as it is possible to work with, sort in piece and then write back the sorted piece, and bring fresh unsorted data in to the memory.</p>

<p>Once all data is sorted in pieces, these pieces can be then merged in a similar fashion.</p>

<p>This process is called as "external sorting'' as we imagine that the data is available externally to the computer. Merge sort is one such sorting algorithm that extends naturally to an external setting.</p>

<p>Problem: Develop the idea of external sorting using merge sort. Describe the nature of data movements that are to be used in your scheme.</p>

<p>Problem: Why would insertion sort not work in an external setting? </p>

<p>Since it is clear that merge sort can work with only partial data, it may be possible to think of a parallel version of merge sort. One can view a parallel algorithm as follows. An algorithm is a sequence of tasks $T1_, T_2, \cdots$. These tasks may have inter-dependecies, so that task $T_i$ should be completed before task $T_j$ for some $i,j$. However, it is often the case that there are several algorithms where many tasks are independent of each other. (In some cases, the algorithm or the computation has to be expressed in that indepedent-task fashion). In such a setting, one can imagine that tasks that are indepedent of each other can be done simultaneously, or in parallel.</p>

<p>Consider such parallel execution and the problem of sorting a given set of numbers. When using merge sort, we divide the input into two parts. These two tasks -- of sorting each part -- are independent of each other and hence can be done in parallel. So let us investigate this possibility further. We have to also merge sorted sequences. The way we have described merge sort, when merging two sequences of length $\ell$ each, we have $2\ell$ tasks. These $2\ell$ tasks find the position of each element in the two merged seuqences in the combined sequence of $2\ell$ elements. These $2\ell$ tasks are also completely dependent in the way they are written. However, a rewrite is possible.</p>

<p>Let us call the two sorted sequences as $A$ and $B$. Think of searching for each element of $A$ in $B$ and vice-versa. Since the sequences $A$ and $B$ are sorted, one can use binary search. Still there are $2\ell$ tasks but these $2\ell$ tasks are independent of each other. Once these tasks finish, one can see that element $A[i]$ from $A$ can be placed at index $i'$ where $i'= i + Rank(A[i], B)$. In the former expression, $Rank(A[i], B)$ refers to the rank of element $A[i]$ in the array $B$ obtained using binary search.<p>

<p>There are several enhancements to the above idea of a simple parallel merge sort. An interested reader can find more details in the book ''An Introduction to Parallel Algorithms'', by J. JaJa.</p>
