          <p>Let us now consdier some interesting ways in which the basic
          experiment can be extended.</p>
          <p>
          We have seen four different representation formats for numbers. Each
          had its own advantages and disadvantages. Consider the following
          representation formats. It holds from the fundamental theorem of
          arithmetic that every positive integer at least 1 can be expressed
          uniquely as the product of prime numbers. How would you add and
          multiply numbers in this format? Also, think of operations on numbers
          that are easier in this format than in other formats.
          </p>
          <p>
          Another related representation that is possible is to use the Chinese
          remainder theorem. The Chinese remainder theorem is a fundamental
          theorem in number theory. It states that any number can be
          represented uniquely as the residue of relatively prime numbers. The
          representation is unique up to the produce of the relative primes
          chosen. For instance, x = 2 (mod 5), and x = 3 (mod 8), implies that
          x = 27. How would you implement the operations add and multiply using
          this representation. Are there operations that are simple in this
          format than other formats?</p>
          <p>
          A related question to think about is to study and implement routines
          for multiplication in the binary number system that are different
          from the standard one. By standard, we mean that multiplication is
          treated as repeated addition. In what circumstances does your routine
          outperform the standard multiplication routine. Also, study the
          multiplication operation used in computer hardware at present. To
          carry our thoughts further, we consider the following questions.
          Notice that some of these questions may be open, and may not have any
          published solution.
          </p>
          <p>
          Design a representation format for numbers so that the following
          operations are all efficient. The operations of interest are : add,
          multiply, gcd, and mod. (mod refers to integer modulo).
          Can you design routines where the size of the numbers being handled
          far exceedes the number sizes that a machine word can handle. Typical
          number sizes that current machines can handle is about 20-25 digits.
          However, there are applications which require one to handle numbers
          of 500 digits or more. How can you support operations on such large
          numbers?
