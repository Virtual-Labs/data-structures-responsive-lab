        Since ancient times, the ability to represent numbers and perform
        arithmetic operations on numbers played an important role. Hence, it is
        interesting to study how different representation formats impact the
        number representation and operations. In this experiment, we study the
        efficacy of various number representation formats. The central message
        of this experiment is to appreciate that something that is as common as
        operating on numbers has an embedded data structure lesson. In this
        experiment, we will first understand how operations such as addition
        and multiplication can be done in various formats. We focus on four
        formats: unary, binary, decimal, and Roman. In each of these four
        representation formats, we will learn how to perform the above two
        operations. You can look at the lecture notes, browse through slides,
        and also see an animation that can run several examples.</p> 
        <p>
        1.1 The Hindu/Arabic System This is also known as the decimal system
        and is presently in vogue in written communication. The systemused 10
        digits 0, 1,2 ··· , 9. For instance three hundred and sixty seven is
        written as 367. This is a positionalnumber system with the rightmost
        position having a weight of 1, the next position a weight of 10, and so
        on.
        </p>
        <p>
        1.2.2 The Roman System This is a system using the symbols I, V, X, L,
        C, and M. This is not a positional system. As an example, 24 is written
        as XXIV.
        </p>
        <p>
        1.2.3 The Unary and the Binary System In the former, the only symbol
        used is I and a number is represented by writing a number of I′s equal
        to its value. For example, 7 is written as IIIIIII. It can be noticed
        that this system is too laborious for large numbers such as those
        beyond 20 or so.In the latter, two symbols 0 and 1 are used. This is a
        positional system with weights of 1, 2, 4, and so on. For instance, 55
        is written as 110111. The latter is popular because of its use in the
        present generation computers.

        1.2.4 Operations on Numbers Let us consider the basic arithmetic
        operations such as addition and multiplication. In the case of addition
        using the Hindu system, we have the notion of a carry so that if the
        sum of any two digits in a position with weight of 10k will create a
        carry of 1 with a weight of 10 k+1. The same is concept holds true for
        positional systems such as the binary system, with the only difference
        being the weights. In the unary system, the addition of numbers x and y
        will result in a number with x + y I′s.Addition in the Roman system is
        much more complicated. To add two numbers in the Roman system,one
        starts by writing the numbers side by side. </p>
        <p>For example, to add 32 and
        53, write XXXII and LIII side by side as XXXII LIII. Then, arrange
        these letters so that the numerals are in decreasing order. We
        get:LXXXIIIII. The five Is can be simplified by writing them as V. So
        we get LXXXV. This process is continued till no simplification is
        possible. Care has to be taken when adding numbers such as 64, written
        as LXIV.Similar observations hold in the case of multiplication as
        multiplication can be treated as repeated addition in its basic form.
        So one way to multiply Roman numbers is to multiply the larger number
        by the smaller number. For example, to multiply 123 by 52, we start by
        writing the numbers as CXXIII and LII. Now, multiply the larger number
        CXIII by L. This is done by first multiplying by 10, which means
        promoting the symbols and then duplicating each symbol five times.
        Simplification can be done to reduce the number to the standard form.
        Then,multiplication by 2 is simply duplicating each symbol twice.
        Simplifying, we get the answer. The above reading suggests that the
        method of number representation does have a bearing on the ease of the
        operation. Hence, even with simple operations such as addition and
        multiplication, a better way to organize data helps in performing the
        operation efficiently. In the rest of this chapter, we will use the
        decimal/binary system. We will carry forward this lesson to other
        operations.
