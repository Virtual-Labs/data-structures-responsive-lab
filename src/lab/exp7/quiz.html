            <p>1. Suppose that G is a directed graph with a vertex u with both a nonzero indegree and a nonzero outdegree. Can u end up in a DFS tree containing only itself? Justify your answer.</p>

            <p>2. Take an example directed graph of about 12 vertices and 20 edges. Perform DFS on the graph and record the discovery and finish time of each vertex.</p>

            <p>3. Repeat the above question with respect to BFS. </p>
          
            <p>4. Suppose that G is a directed graph and (u,v) is an edge in the graph. Is it true that the finish time of u is always larger than the finish time of v?</p>
            <p> 5. Consider the setting of the above question. Suppose now that C and C' are two subsets of vertices so that there is a path between every vertex in C (C') to every other vertex in C (C'), and there is an edge (u,v) with u in C and v in C'. Suppose also that there is no path from any vertex in C' to any vertex in C. Is it true that any vertex in C has a finish time larger than any vertex in C'? Justify your answer.</p>

            <p>6. Let G be an undirected graph and we apply BFS on G. Classify the edges of G as tree edges, back edges, forward edges, and cross edges. Are any of these classes empty? If so, why?</p>

            <p> 7. Let G be an undirected graph. Use DFS on G to partition the vertices of G into subsets V1, V2, ..., so that two vertices u and v are in the same partition if and only if there is a path between u to v. Such subsets are called as the connected components of G.</p>

            <p>8. Let G have k connected components. How would k change if one edge is added to G? How would k change if one edge is removed from G.</p>
            <p>9. Consider the problem of arranging the vertices of a directed acyclic graph so that if (u,v) is an edge in the graph then $u$ appears before $v$ in the arragenment. Such an arrangement is called as a topological sorting of the graph. Design an algorithm using DFS to obtain a topological sort of a given directed acyclic graph. What is the runtime of your algorithm.</p>
            <p>10. Repeat the above question with using BFS instead of DFS. Is there any difference in the runtime? Which approach do you prefer and why? </p>
